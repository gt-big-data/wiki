# Current Events: Twitter

## Question
Can we cluster tweets to find current events?
Are some accounts more responsible for starting these clusters of tweets on a recent event?
How do the clusters on recent events spread (virality)?
Measure importance/relevance of information through virality?

Examples would be how does "The princess had a baby?" spread.
