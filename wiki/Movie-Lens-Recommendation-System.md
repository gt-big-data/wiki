# Movie Lens Recommendation System

## Participants
Patrick Violette and Philippe Laban

## Description
**How can we recommend movies to users?**

Using K nearest neighbor we created a recommendation system.

## Methods
We got our data from the Movie Lens.

## Results
Probably have simple website with a database that contains the results.
Make it useful, people enter the movies they've watched (which gives us more data to treat)
And once they've entered the movies they've seen (like 50), they get suggestions.
Also, making the GUI for how to display what movies they might have seen at first can be an interesting problem (decision tree building)

## Code
