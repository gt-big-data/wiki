# TrollBot and Google NGrams

This program would use Google NGrams (http://aws.amazon.com/datasets/8172056142375670) and another similarly structured dataset made up of insults, down-voted comments on Reddit, and possibly 4chan comments.
We would harness the power of Ngrams to generate:

* In the case of Google Books: short hopefully coherent stories

* In the case of rude comments: even ruder, more offensive comments

If this were accomplished, TrollBot would be programmed to respond to poor online comments, probably just on YouTube, with it's own ngram-generated sentences.
