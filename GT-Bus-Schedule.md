# GT Bus Schedule

http://m.cip.gatech.edu/api/buses is the API for next bus data at Georgia Tech

How can it be useful / what can we do with it?
* How accurate is the data?
* When is traffic?
* Is it faster to take the bus or to walk somewhere, especially if I'm not at a bus stop already? What if I take multiple bus rides?
